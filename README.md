# the-involuntary-existence
My first book and launch of my "Book 3.0" concept - one book coming in several forms aimed at different groups of readers and individuals to get the points across as effectively as possible.

I think that I will eventually put various renditions of the book here, for you to help, correct and clarify sentences and add references to make it ever better together <3
First/last release of the book, will be around the Epiphany-weekend 2025, 5th January. 

And then we move together towards the bright light of the primary version ;)
