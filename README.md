# the-involuntary-existence
My first book and launch of my "Book 3.0" concept - one book coming in several forms aimed at different groups of readers and individuals to get the points across as effectively as possible.

I think that I will put various renditions of the book here, for you to help correct and clarify sentences and add references to make it ever better together <3
